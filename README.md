# A solution for cryptograhical algorithms

## Homework 1

Task description:  

```txt
Implement Caesar and Vigenere encryption and decryption.
```

The solution was implemented in the Rust programming language and resides inside `homework1` directory. 
The solution can be run with a tailored Docker container, composed from the `docker-compose.yml` file, 
residing at the root of this repository. 
For more information about "how to run", logic behind the solution and nuances, 
you can read the outline in the provided [README.md](homework1/README.md) file, inside the `homework1` directory.  

## Homework 2

Task description:  

```txt
Implement Diffie-Hellman algorithm, RSA encryption and decryption, and a brute force calculation of an RSA private key based on a public one.
```

The solution resides inside `homework2` directory. 
The solution can be run with a tailored Docker container, composed from the `docker-compose.yml` file, 
residing at the root of this repository. 
For more information about "how to run", logic behind the solution and nuances, 
you can read the outline in the provided [README.md](homework2/README.md) file, inside the `homework2` directory.  

## Homework 3

Task description:  

```txt
Convert the first and the second homeworks to a web application,
implementing Caesar, Vigenere, Diffie-Hellman and RSA.
Save operations to a simple database,
pay attention to the resource ownership!
```

> THE SOLUTION IS UNFINISHED!

The partial solution resides inside `homework3` directory. 
For more information about the ideas for the implementation and why it is unfinished, you can read the outline in the provided [README.md](homework3/README.md) file, inside the `homework3` directory.
